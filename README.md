## Overview

*This repository contains a model for classifying likelihood of survival of passengers in titanic. 
*The model is built using data science techniques.
*This project demonstrates how to preprocess titanic data, transform it into numerical features, and train a classifier to predict a survival likelihood of passengers.
*The classifier is trained using a classifier algorithm (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Neural network, Random Forest, Voting Classifier) which extracts features from the SMS messages

## Dataset

*The titanic spam collection dataset is used for training and evaluating the classifier. 
*This dataset consists of details of passengers labeled as Survived 
*The dataset can be downloaded from here.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Python Libraries 

- Pandas:For using dataset

## Getting Started Titanic Classification using Five Advanced Classifier:

Follow these steps to run the code and obtain 

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samyuktha343/BI-TITANIC-CLASSIFICATION.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Titanic Classification using Five Advanced Classifier
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python libraries as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

4. **Data Preparation:**

   We loaded titanic datsets from Kaggle

5. **Configure Parameters:**

   Open the `config.py` file and set the required parameters.

6. **Run the Code:**

   Execute the main script to analyze Titanic Classification using Five Advanced Classifier.

   ```bash
   python Titanic Classification.py
   ```

   The script will perform data preprocessing, classifying the survival rate of passengers in titanic.

7. **View Results:**

   The results and visualizations will be saved in the `output` folder. You can explore them to gain insights into  Titanic Classification using Five Advanced Classifier.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the code by modifying the parameters in the `config.py` file. Some of the key configurations include:

- `DATA_FILE`: Path to the input transaction data file.
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Path to the output directory where results will be saved.
- Other parameters related to visualization and data preprocessing.

## Results

The code will generate various insights and visualizations, including:

-Classifies survival rate of passengers using 5 advanced classifiers with high accuracy.
